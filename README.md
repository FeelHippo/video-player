# React Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Backend:

Important: 
    - my [authentication API](https://github.com/FeelHippo/FinalBack) will run on http://localhost:5000/
    - the [video API](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation) has a limit of 200 search results per hour!!

### Frontend:
    - start the app with `npm start`, will run on http://localhost:3000/
    - I had to use plain css because of [this problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64625050/error-node-sass-version-5-0-0-is-incompatible-with-4-0-0)
    - to toggle an item's favorite status, I would use the api, but in this case the app relies on local storage
